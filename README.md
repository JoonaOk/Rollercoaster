Followed Rob Mullas Youtube video "Exploratory Data Analysis with Pandas Python 2023" to learn how to use Pandas in data analysis. Learned many skills like heatmaps, seaborn for correlations analysis and how to handel data with Pandas.

Also searched answer for my own question regarding the data at the end of the project.
